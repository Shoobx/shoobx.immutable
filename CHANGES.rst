1.2.0 (2020-01-20)
------------------

- Extended `IRevisionedImmutableManager` to support efficient version
  management.

  * Added `getNumberOfRevisions(obj)` method to return the number of revisions
    available for a given object. Note that this does not necessarily equal to
    the latest revision number.

  * Exended `getRevisionHistory()` with multiple new arguments to support
    filtering, sorting and batching:

    Filter Arguments:

    * `creator`: The creator of the revision must match the argument.

    * `comment`: The comment must contain the argument as a substring.

    * `startBefore`: The revision must start before the given date/time.

    * `startAfter`: The revision must start after the given date/time.

    Ordering Arguments:

    * `reversed`: When true, the history will be return in reverse
                  chronological order, specifically the latest revision is
                  listed first.

    Batching Arguments:

    * `batchStart`: The index at which to start the batch.

    * `batchSize`: The size the of the batch. It is thus the max length of
                   the iterable.

- Provided an implementation of the new arguments for both the simple revision
  manage and the pjpersist container.

- Declare that `ImmutableContainer` implements `IRevisionedImmutableManager`.

- Increased test coverage back to 100%.


1.1.1 (2019-06-11)
------------------

- Added `datetime` classes as system immutable types.


1.1.0 (2019-05-31)
------------------

- Introduced `__im_version__` to `IRevisionedImmutable` and use it instead of
  timestamps to create a chronological order of revisions. (Timestamps might be
  slightly different accross servers and cause bad history.)

- Do not duplicate implementation of `__im_update__()` in
  `RevisionedImmutableBase`. Use `__im_[before|after]_update__()` to do all
  revision-related tasks.

- Tweak `copy()` implementation for `ImmutableList` and `ImmutableDict`.

- Properly implement `ImmutableDict.fromkeys()`.


1.0.5 (2019-05-31)
------------------

- Fix `ImmutableList.copy()` to just work when locked. This allows for only
  making a shallow clone, since any update will cause a deep copy and thus
  immutability is guaranteed.

- Implemented `ImmutableDict.copy()`. Raise error on `ImmutableDict.fromkeys()`.

- `ImmutableContainer` also needs an updated `_pj_column_fields` list.

- Minor test fixes.

- Minor documentation fixes and code comment enhancements.


1.0.4 (2019-05-30)
------------------

- Add API documentation.


1.0.3 (2019-05-30)
------------------

- Moved documentation to Read the Docs.


1.0.2 (2019-05-30)
------------------

- Add some readable documentation.

- Added high-level `shoobx.immutable.update(im, *args, **kw)` function.

- Implemented `__repr__()` for `ImmutableSet` to mimic behavior of
  `ImmutableDict` and `ImmutableList`.


1.0.1 (2019-05-30)
------------------

- Fix package description.


1.0.0 (2019-05-30)
------------------

- Immutable Types, Immutable Dict, Immutable Set, Immutable List

- Revisioned Immutable with Revision Manager sample implementation

- Optional: pjpersist support for immutables. Requires pjpersist>=1.7.0.

- Initial Release
