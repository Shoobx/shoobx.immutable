class IImmutable(zope.interface.Interface):
    """Immutable Object

    In an immutable object no data can be modified. To modify state, a copy
    of the object must be created into which the changes are applied.

    When trying to modify an attribute of a locked immutable, an
    `AttributeError` is raised with the message saying that the attribute
    cannot be set. The only exceptions are internal attributes which are
    determined using the `__im_is_internal_attr__(name) -> bool` method.

    Immutables are created using the `__im_create__()` context manager in the
    following way::

      with Immutable.__im_create__() as factory:
          im = factory(attr=value)

    Immutables are updated using the `__im_update__()` context manager in the
    following way::

      with im.__im_update__() as im2:
          im2.attr = value2

    In the example above, `im` is not modified and all changes are applied to
    `im2`.

    The algorithm works as follows:

    1. The `__im_update__()` method is used to create a context manager.

    2. Upon entering the context manager, a clone of the original immutable is
       created and returned as context.

    3. The clone is in the `transient` state, allowing all data to be
       modified. Note that modifications can be made at any depth in the
       object.

    4. Upon exiting the context manager, the clone is put in the `locked`
       state.

    Internally, updating deeply nested objects is managed by assigning a mode
    to the immutable. The `master` mode describes an immutable that can be
    updated while a `slave` (sub-object) is updated as part of its master. The
    following rules apply:

    1. All immutable sub-objects must be `slave` immutables.

    2. A `master` immutable cannot be assigned or added to another immutable,
       whether that's a `master` or `slave`.

    3. Only `master` immutables can call `__im_update__()`.

    4. Any immutable object can only have sub-objects that are also immutable
       or can be made immutable upon assignment.[1]

    ..[1] During initialization all class attributes are checked to be
          immutable or are converted to immutables. On assignment, any mutable
          object is converted into an immutable object. If convertsion to an
          immutable object fails, a `ValueError` error is raised.

    Conversion of mutable to immutable objects:

    1. All immutable objects are ignored. These object include all Python core
       immutables and any object providing this `IImmutable` interface.

    2. A conversion from lists, dicts and sets is provided.

    3. A mutable object can implement the `__im_get__()` method to provide an
       immutable version of itself.  Note: `__im_get__()` must NOT return the
       same object instance!
